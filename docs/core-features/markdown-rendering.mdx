# Markdown Rendering (MDX)

## Objective
Render markdown content with the ability to embed React components (MDX).

## Implementation
- **Libraries**: `@next/mdx`, `remark`, `rehype`
- **Details**: We will use `@next/mdx` to handle the transformation of MDX into HTML. `remark` and `rehype` plugins will be used to process the markdown, enabling features like syntax highlighting and a table of contents.

### Tasks
- [x] Install and configure `@next/mdx`.
- [x] Create a generic layout component for markdown pages.
- [x] Implement a Table of Contents component that generates links from `h1`, `h2`, and `h3` tags.
- [ ] Add custom React components to be used within MDX files.
