## Features
- **File-Based Routing**: Routes are automatically generated based on the folder structure in the docs directory.
- **MDX Bundler Integration**: Allows you to write documentation using markdown and embed React components seamlessly.
- **OpenAPI Spec Generation**: If a folder contains a .yaml file, an OpenAPI spec will be auto-generated and made available at the corresponding route.

### Folder structure
``` Files
/docs
  ├── introduction.md         # Main documentation file for the intro page
  ├── setup.md                # Setup guide
  ├── api
  │   ├── get-api.md          # Overview of the API
  │   ├── put-api.md          # User-related API documentation
  │   ├── openapi.yaml        # OpenAPI specification for the API
  ├── getting-started.md      # Getting Started guide
  ├── advanced.md             # Advanced topics
  ├── troubleshooting.md      # Troubleshooting guide
```

## Routing
The file structure inside the docs folder dictates the routing of the app. Here's how the routing is mapped:
- `docs/introduction.md` → /introduction
- `docs/setup.md` → /setup
- `docs/api/index.md` → /api
- `docs/api/user.md` → /api/user
- `docs/getting-started.md` → /getting-started

### Dynamic Routes
If you add subfolders or markdown files within any folder, those will be reflected in the sidebar and linked accordingly. For example:
- `docs/api/auth.md` → /api/auth

### OpenAPI Spec
If there's a .yaml file (e.g., openapi.yaml) within any folder, an OpenAPI spec will automatically be generated at that route. For example:
- `docs/api/openapi.yaml` → /api/openapi
