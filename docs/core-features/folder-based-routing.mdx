# Folder-Based Routing

## Objective
Automatically generate pages based on markdown files stored in the `docs` folder.

## Implementation
- **Framework**: Next.js
- **Details**: We will leverage Next.js's built-in file-system based routing. Any `.mdx` or `.md` file created within the `/pages/docs` directory will automatically become a route. For example, `pages/docs/getting-started.mdx` will be accessible at `/docs/getting-started`.

### Tasks
- [x] Set up a Next.js project.
- [x] Create a `docs` folder inside the `pages` directory.
- [x] Add initial markdown files to test the routing.
- [x] Implement dynamic routing for nested folders.
