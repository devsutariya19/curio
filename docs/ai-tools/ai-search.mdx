This feature moves beyond traditional keyword matching to provide a more intelligent, semantic search experience.

### Feature: AI-Powered Semantic Search
Instead of just looking for keywords, the AI search understands the *meaning* and *intent* behind a user's query. This allows users to ask questions in natural language and receive highly relevant results, even if the exact words aren't in the documentation.

- **How it Works**:
    1.  **Vector Embeddings**: When a document is saved, its content is broken into chunks and converted into numerical representations (vector embeddings) using a machine learning model. These are stored in Supabase using the `pg_vector` extension.
    2.  **Query Analysis**: When a user types a query, the search term is also converted into a vector embedding.
    3.  **Similarity Search**: The system then performs a similarity search to find the document chunks whose embeddings are closest to the query's embedding, ensuring conceptual relevance.

- **Benefits**:
    -   Finds relevant content even with typos or different phrasing.
    -   Users can ask questions like "How do I set up authentication?" instead of just searching for "auth".
    -   Can be extended to provide direct, AI-generated answers synthesized from the most relevant documents.
