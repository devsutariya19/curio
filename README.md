A fast, modern, and collaborative documentation site powered by Next.js and Supabase.

This project provides a complete solution for building a documentation website with built-in content management, real-time collaboration, and powerful AI-driven search. It's designed to be easy for non-technical users to contribute while offering advanced features for developers.



## Project Status
This project is currently under development. I am working on several features and updates, and the main functionality is about 60% complete. Please feel free to check the issues section for more details on what's being worked on.

### In Development
- [ ] Full Supabase Integration: Connecting authentication, database storage for documents, and user roles to the frontend.
- [ ] GitHub Integration: Connect GitHub repository to keep documentation in sync
- [ ] AI Semantic Search: Implementing an advanced search that understands natural language queries.
